Twinn-ml-interface is a Python package for *data contracts between machine learning code and infrastructure*.

### Installation

The easiest way to install is package is using pip:
```
pip install twinn-ml-interface
```

## Model Interface

### Purpose

The Model Interface defines the required methods and attributes that any ML model needs to have in order to run in our infrastructure.

## Testing compliance of your model with the data contract
### Instance of the Model Interface

Once all the attributes and methods from the __Protocol__ `ModelInterfaceV4` are implemented, including the correct type-hints / annotations, we can check if our models is compliant with the interface if it passes the `isinstance` check with `ModelInterfaceV4`. You can find a base test in `twinn_ml_interface/interface/model_test.py`. The [Darrow-Poc](https://github.com/RoyalHaskoningDHV/darrow-poc) is an example of a model that follows the ModelInterfaceV4.

### Mock Executors

The `executor` class takes care of running the model either for training or predictions in our infrastructure. Here, we implemented a mock executor to emulate that behaviour to some extent, which hopefully makes it a little clearer in what context the model class will be used. Any model compliant with the ModelInterface should be able to train and predict using the `ExecutorMock` that can be found in `twinn_ml_interface/mocks/mocks.py`. The [Darrow-Poc](https://github.com/RoyalHaskoningDHV/darrow-poc) is an example of a model that follows `ModelInterfaceV4` and, for instance, can run using the `ExecutorMock`.

The steps and methods that the infrastructure and the mock executor run during training are:
1. Read config:
    - `get_target_template()`
    - `get_train_window_finder_config_template()`
2. Initialize the model
    - `initialize()`
3. Given the configuration for the train window finder in the previous steps, validate possible windows:
    - `validate_input_data()`
4. Read the data configuration to download all the needed data in a window selected by the previous step:
    - `get_data_config_template()`
5. Transform the input data as needed:
    - `preprocess()`
6. Train:
    - `train()`
7. Store the model:
    - `dump()`

When the training is finished, the model can be used for predicting. The prediction steps are:
1. Retrieve the model from storage and load it:
    - `load()`
2. Fetch the data needed for prediction based on **either**:
    -  `base_features` - if present
    - `get_data_config_template()` - otherwise
3. Predict:
    - `predict()`
4. Load configuration to post predictions:
    - `get_result_template()`
